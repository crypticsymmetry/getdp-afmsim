// Gmsh script describing the geometry of an electromagnet with an iron core and
// two coil sides, surrounded by air. The 3D setup is invariant along the
// out-of-plane direction "z" (the axis of the coils), so we model a 2D
// cross-section in the "(x, y)" plane. The two additional symmetries of this
// cross-section -- with respect to the X-axis (separating the two coil sides)
// and to the Y-axis (passing through the core) -- make it possible to model
// only a half (or even a quarter) of the cut. The "SymmetryType" parameter
// defined in "electromagnet_common.pro" selects which part is meshed.

// We include a file with the dimensions as well as the symmetry type; the same
// file will be included in electromagnet.pro to guarantee consistency between
// Gmsh and GetDP:
